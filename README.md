## General Information
The aim of this project is to show the predicted exchange rate using Data Science tools. 
I wanted to expand my knowledge and practice it using matplotlib, numpy, pandas. 
In this proejct, the new library for me is the one used in Machine Learning scikit-learn. 


## Technologies Used
- matplotlib==3.6.3
- numpy==1.24.1
- pandas==1.5.2
- scikit-learn==1.2.0
- seaborn==0.12.2
- sklearn==0.0.post1
- yfinance==0.2.3


## Features
This program show currency rate prediction by two kinds algorithms. The first is Decision Tree Algorithm and the second is Linear Regression. All results were shown in the charts.


## Setup
Every requirements are inside file requirements.txt
- Installation procedure:

`pip install (libraries name)`


## Usage
It is a console program. Run the application via `main.py`.


## Project Status
Project is in progress. I am going to expand my program about the option of choosing a currency.
